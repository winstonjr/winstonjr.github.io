"Do or do not, there is no try". I like to think that way. For this reason I have never tried to make a blog before. I always tried to make difference inside my team mainly talking and educating about practices that I believe could helps us to make a sustainable platform, increase the freedom of our users and helping us to have a good rest on the weekends without unexpected calls.

The craft of software development is changing quickier than before, not learning new stuff is not a choice. This blog is just about this. My tryouts to solve problems that I have in daily basis or just curiosity and the will to try "at least once" as the blog name says.

Lately I am very interested on integration patterns and frameworks. Than probably this will be the focus for a while. But my interests are always changing. There are other matters that interests me and then, sometimes, they can pop on this blog.
